## My process

i searched the code i can use, then i tried to replicte the goal by using the codes i found while searching but it became problematic. the dropdown menus work but not in the proper way/correct.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Pycharm

### What I learned

i learned how to use nav, how to create a semi proper website page, and it helped mem learn a few new things to help me next time i make html website.
```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```
### Continued development

i would like to try and continue java script because i am still quite a bit confused.
i would also like to continue learning css and dropdown to figure out and fix the problem that happened
### Useful resources
